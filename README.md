## Title : Matrix Multiplication in C++
### Description:
This repository contains a C++ program that performs matrix multiplication. The program allows the user to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices, checks if multiplication is possible, and then computes and displays the resultant matrix.
### Features:
- User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the dimensions and elements of two matrices.
- Validation: It checks if the multiplication is feasible based on the dimensions of the matrices.
- Matrix Multiplication: Implements the standard algorithm for multiplying two matrices.
- Output: Displays the resultant matrix after multiplication.
